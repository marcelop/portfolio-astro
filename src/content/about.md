### Hi, I'm Marcelo Perez 👋

I've been photographing for over 10 years, focusing primarily on travel photography. I've always wanted to keep and cherish moments, 
both the remarkable and the mundane. My journey began with a simple point-and-shoot camera while traveling abroad, which sparked a passion that has
never left me ever since.
Beauty really is everywhere if we look closely. My goal is to capture these fleeting instances, admire them, and share it with others.
